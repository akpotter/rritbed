# Turtlesim
Spawn a turtle that reads from turtle1/cmd_vel and publishes to turtle1/pose and turtle1/color_sensor.

## How to use
- See --help

## Constraints
- Can't spawn multiple turtles (but would be easy to implement).
- Turtle frame has a fixed size (changing this would require changes in pose processing!).

## Pitfalls
None

## Missing functionality
See constraints.
