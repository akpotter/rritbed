# ros_tools
Instead of stopping all ROS nodes centralised with Ctrl-C, each node itself can also be stopped with a STOP file. This tool handles creating the correct file and deleting it again.

## How to use
[python] ros_tools.py stop please_do

## Constraints
Requires the path ~/ros to exist.

## Pitfalls
None

## Missing functionality
Create required folder automatically.
